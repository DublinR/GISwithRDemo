Geostatistical mapping
========================
The objective of geostatistical mapping is to generate spatial predictions of some target variable for a study area of interest. The outputs from geostatistical mapping are usually standard:

* Observed values (point locations)
* Geostatistical model (i.e. a list of fitted parameters)
* Predicted values (gridded map)
* Results of validation (point locations)
