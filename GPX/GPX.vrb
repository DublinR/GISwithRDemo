Here is the \texttt{R} command sequence that loads and runs the program:

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> source("ExtractWaypoints.r")
> TheDriver()
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
Here are the plots. Note that two 'outlier' waypoints are omitted from the right-side plot as they do not fall within the tracks.
